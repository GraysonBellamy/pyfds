"""Heat Transfer Examples.

This module contains examples demonstrating heat transfer modeling in FDS,
including conduction through solids, convection, and thermal boundary conditions.

Examples
--------
1. conduction_1d.py - 1D heat conduction through solid
2. conduction_kc.py - Temperature-dependent conductivity
3. convective_cooling.py - Convective boundary conditions
4. adiabatic_surface.py - Adiabatic surface temperature
5. ht3d_sphere.py - 3D heat transfer in solid
6. thermocouples.py - Thermocouple response time
