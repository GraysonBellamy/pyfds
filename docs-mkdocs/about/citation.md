## Text Citation

When referencing PyFDS in text:

> "The simulations were created and executed using PyFDS (Bellamy, ), a Python interface to the Fire Dynamics Simulator."

## Citing FDS

PyFDS is an interface to FDS. When using PyFDS, you should also cite FDS itself:

### FDS Citation

```bibtex
@techreport{fds_technical_guide,
  title = {Fire Dynamics Simulator, Technical Reference Guide},
  author = {McGrattan, Kevin and Hostikka, Simo and McDermott, Randall and
            Floyd, Jason and Weinschenk, Craig and Overholt, Kristopher},
  institution = {National Institute of Standards and Technology},
  address = {Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA},
  year = {2023},
  number = {NIST Special Publication 1018-1},
  edition = {Sixth},
  url = {https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/}
}
```

### FDS Text Citation

> "Fire simulations were performed using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) version 6.9.0 (McGrattan et al., 2023), accessed through the PyFDS Python interface (Bellamy, )."

## Example Acknowledgment

Include PyFDS in your acknowledgments section:

> "This research utilized PyFDS (Bellamy, ), an open-source Python interface for the Fire Dynamics Simulator (McGrattan et al., 2023)."

## DOI (Coming Soon)

A DOI will be assigned upon the first stable release (v1.0.0) for permanent citation.
